Six Blessed Apples, but not a single Rod of Discord.
The Golem giving you his fifth Sun Stone without any Picksaw.
Two hours of generating worlds in search of a Pyramid - in vain.
Just one underground painting missing for your collection.
Fishing, no comment needed.

Does that sound familiar ? If yes, you have been visited by the R.N.Goddess and found unworthy. But thanks to this mod, your troubles are over !

TokenMod is a mod that adds special crafting components to the game, dropping randomly within the world. These components allow you to craft (almost) all rare or hard-to-find items in the game from the comfort of your home.

Quick changelog (See github commits for full changes)

v1.3.0 - Swap and furniture balancing and new icon
Swap recipes now use a fixed fraction of the original price instead of ignoring the rarity
Most furniture items are more expensive but can now be swapped
Large swap tables now make use of an intermediate "swap" token that can be redeemed for a cheap item (Unchanged final cost, this is only for performance reasons)

Fixed the Sniper scope being craftable instead of the Rifle scope
Lowered the cost of post-plantera dungeon melee and ranged enemy drops
