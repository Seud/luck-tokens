# Luck Tokens

*A tModLoader mod for Terraria allowing crafting of rare items.*

Six Blessed Apples, but not a single Rod of Discord.
The Golem giving you his fifth Sun Stone without any Picksaw.
Two hours of generating worlds in search of a Pyramid - in vain.
Just one underground painting missing for your collection.
Fishing, no comment needed.

Does that sound familiar ? If yes, you have been visited by the R.N.Goddess and found unworthy. But thanks to this mod, your troubles are over !

Luck Tokens is a mod that adds special crafting components to the game, dropping randomly within the world. These components allow you to craft (almost) all rare or hard-to-find items in the game from the comfort of your home.

## New items

New items are sorted in four categories that are used for various purposes.

* Luck Essence is the new main component, and can be acquired from any Token source. Almost every item requires Luck essence, the quantity being determined by the rarity of the object.
* Location tokens are used to craft items linked to specific biomes and locations. They can be acquired from killing enemies in the appropriate biome.
* Tier Tokens are used to craft items of a certain Tier, depending on their acquisition method (Some items are slightly adjusted for balance, such as the Reaver Shark). They can be acquired from killing enemies, the dropped Tier depending on defeted bosses. The world is split in 8 tiers, as follow :
  * Tier 0 : Early-game, surface forest, pre-EoC (Items of this tier do not require any Tier Tokens)
  * Tier 1 : Pre-Hardmode, Pre-EoW items (Mostly Cavern and other Surface biomes)
  * Tier 2 : Pre-Hardmode, post-EoW items - notably includes Space, Dungeon, Underworld, Underground Jungle items
  * Tier 3 : Hardmode, pre-Mechanical boss items
  * Tier 4 : Post-MB, pre-Plantera items
  * Tier 5 : Post-Plantera, pre-Golem items
  * Tier 6 : Post-Golem, pre-Moon Lord items
  * Tier 7 : Post-Moon Lord items (Not a lot !)
  Tier tokens can be downgraded for free. Tier 1 tokens can additionally be recycled for Luck Essence.
* Special Tokens are acquired differently and have various uses
  * Boss Tokens are acquired from bosses (Or Treasure Bags if Expert mode is enabled) and used to craft Boss items
  * Eternia Stones are exchanged 1:1 from Defender Medals and contain Invasion Tokens, Tier Tokens and Luck Essence
  * Fishing Crates are acquired from fishing and contain Fishing Tokens (Used for crafting special Fish and Fishing quest rewards), Tier Tokens and Luck Essence.
  * Invasion Tokens are acquired from Invasion-type event (Both progress and time-llimited) and used to craft related items
  * NPC Tokens can be acquired by killing critters ~~and other friendlies~~ and are used to craft NPC drops
  * Shadow Locked Tokens can be created for a marginal sum and unllocked with a Shadow Key to create Shadow Chest items
  * Traveling Merchant Tokens are purchased from the Merchant and are used to create Traveling Merchant items or to duplicate them (The latter does not cost Essence or Tokens). Each token is worth 10 silver and used to create 10 silver worth of Traveling Merchant items.
  * Weather Tokens are acquired during special weather and are used to create items from Weather-restricted enemies
  * The Meteor Charm is a craftable item that summons a Meteorite on the world. This does not override standard Meteorite restrictions (e.g. block limit)

## Crafting recipes

All recipes created by the mod are available at an anvil. Most recipes follow one of several schemas :

* Items with Normal recipes are crafted using Luck essence, a Tier token and up to two special tokens. Most recipes follow this schema. Costs rise with item rarity and tier. Some items require additional components outlining special acquisition rules (For example, Dungeon items require a Golden Key)
* Items with Swap recipes can additionally be crafted using a little Luck essence and another item of the same pool. This is mostly relevant for boss and chest/mimic items.
* Items with Traveling Merchant recipes can be duplicated. Duplicating cheap objects (e.g. Dynasty Wood) requires a stack of the original size but onlly requires Traveling Merchant tokens.

Currently, recipes include the following (As a general rule, craftable, purchasable, plants and consumables are excluded) :

* Almost all enemy drops with a droprate lower than 10%
* Almost all enemy drops from invasion events
* All enemy drops from rare enemies (Showing up on the Lifeform Analyzer)
* Almost all non-guaranteed Boss items (Excluding Dev items, Expert items and Achievement items, e.g. 0x33's Aviators)
* Most friendly NPC items (But you would *never*... right ?)
* Most primary chest items (e.g. Magic Mirror, Flamelash)
* Most other useful exploration items (e.g. Life Crystal/Fruits, Enchanted Swords, Shadow/Crimson Orb items)
* Most Wireable traps
* Dye components, Strange plants and Rare Dyes
* Golden Critters, Truffle Worms and Tree Nymph Butterflies (Do not ask how it works)
* Jellyfish and weapon/tool fish
* Fishing crate items
* Uncraftable furniture (Includes decorative banners, uncraftable chests, dungeon and underworld decorations)
* Uncraftable statues
* Non-painter paintings
* Angler items
* Traveling and Skeleton Merchant items
* Seasonal items
